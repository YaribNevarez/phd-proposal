\section{Research goals}
The goal of this research is to contribute to state-of-the-art knowledge with formal methodologies to address hardware design for energy-efficient neural network accelerators based on approximate computing.

\subsection{Outcomes}
The expected outcome of this PhD is to derive formal methodologies for neural network accelerators based on approximate computing. As a demonstration, it is expected to develop two neural network accelerators based on approximate computing:

\begin{itemize}
\item SNN accelerator to assist research in Neurosciences.
\item Deep CNN accelerator to assist industrial computer vision applications (e.g., real-time multiple object detection).
\end{itemize}
