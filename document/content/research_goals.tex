\section{Research goals}
The goal of this research is to contribute to state-of-the-art knowledge with formal methodologies to address hardware design for neural network accelerators based on approximate computing.

\subsection{Outcomes}
The expected outcome of this PhD is to derive formal methodologies for neural network accelerators based on approximate computing. As a demonstration, it is expected to develop two high-efficiency neural network accelerator architectures:

\begin{itemize}
\item SNN accelerator applied for fundamental research
\item Deep CNN accelerator for industrial computer vision applications (e.g., real-time multiple object detection and classification)
\end{itemize}
